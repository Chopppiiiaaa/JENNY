      <p>This new semester, we started this project called Sell Asti, whom Mr. Rodriguez, my Econ teacher made for us to do with a group. How do you Advertise a school? Well as students we were given a lot of different resources to help us with Advertising and Selling different products as practice brefore getting into Advertising our school for our starting our project.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="well">
       <p>As our group decided to split jobs, I choose to do our Advertisements. I had choices yet I wanted to actually develope a website instead of fliers or paper advertising because I believe more people would encounter my advertising website when shared through social media. I also wanted to give them a student made website that would astonish them with the real quick view of what this school is like. And because its a student made website I think I get alot of different perspectives of all of my peers in this school who wanted to share what they thought. This website really is just all made of them and informs you alot about what makes this school different from others.</p>
